Odin project "Members Only!" exercise.

Simple web page where members (signed up users) can write posts, everyone can see all the written posts, but only members can see post's author.

Application contains 2 models, User and Post. Only signed up users are able to create and edit their own posts.

All pages and forms are styled.

This is my actual first attempt to build a simple app using rails framework.
